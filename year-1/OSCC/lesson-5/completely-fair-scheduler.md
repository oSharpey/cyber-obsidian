# The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
- Used in linux
- A computationally optimised implementation of the Proportional Share Scheduler
	- Minimise time spent on the scheduling decisions
	- Optimise data structures used
- Aims to fairly divide a CPU evenly among all competing processes
- Multi queue approach in multi-core systems
