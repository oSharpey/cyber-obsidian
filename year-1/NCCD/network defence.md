# Network Defence

## Defence in depth
### What is it?
- A security strategy they involves implementung

### How to implement it
- Segment the network - Break the network into smaller zones with their own security controls
- Firewalls - Used to control access to a network by allowing to only authorised traffic
- Encryption - Use of encrypted protocols

### How does it work
- First layer - Perimeter firewall, controls access to the organisations network. Need to secure the first access point of the network
- Second layer - Segment the network into different zones - DMZ etc
- IDS/IPS used to monitor network traffic and block suspicious activity
- Use proper authentication methods to control access
- Have an incident team and disaster recovery plan

### Some common mistakes
- Over-reliance on a single security control
- Not segmenting the network
- Not testing the security controls - Directionality is important
- Not monitoring the network
- Not keeping software up to date
- Not considering the human factor - humans are the weakest link

## Network Segmentation
### Common types of network segmentation
- DMZ - a network segment that contains p
