	- Follows last in first out (LIFO) principle
- Grows from high memory to low memory
- **PUSH** instruction puts data on the stack
- **POP** instruction takes data off of the stack
- 32 bit system: 4 bytes at a time
- 64 bit system: 8 bytes at a time
- RSP/ESP - points to top of stack frame
- RBP/EBP - points to bottom of stack frame
