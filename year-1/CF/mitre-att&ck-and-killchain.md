## Why is Threat Intel Important


# MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Intro
- Mitre ATT&CK is always growing and changing, 


## Background
- pre att&ck - before attack happens
- Mitre for cloud
- Mitre for IoT



# Cyber Kill Chain
- Dont have to use all the 
## Reconasense
- Did the scan IPs
- What did they do to find out about their target
- Eg wannacry - Active scanning, scanning the internet for public facing port 445 (SMB) anyone with the p

- For coursework explain more about the tool

## Delivery
- How do you deliver it to the victim
- Can pick multiple different access points into the system
- eg wannacry used email, SMB and DoublePulsar backdoor

## Exploitation
- Running the code

## Instillation
- Code is installed, persistence 
- Installing Remote Access Trojans (RATs) or backdoors
