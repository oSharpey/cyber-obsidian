# How to start on the coursework
- Research 2-3 of the cyber attacks and find sources
	- How many sources are there 
	- Are the sources good quality
- Find some already written cyber attack reports and see how others write them
- Harj is expected for me to name newer cyber attacks
- Research and identify what infrastructure that the cyber attacks impacted and in what way 
- Find out how to write an executive summary
	- What are the rules around them
	- Its not an abstract or an introduction
	- **THIS IS THE LAST THING YOU WRITE**
	- Should give you an overview of what the report is about
- Background
	- Get some examples of timelines (copy and paste maybe)
	- Get context around the threat actors 
		- Are they state actors, hacktivists, etc
		- What other campaigns have they been involved in
	- Point 2 
		- Get data, stats 
		- Not enough just to say it "knocked out the power supply"
- Analysis
	- **ONLY DO ONE CYBER ATTACK**
	- Draw a kill chain
	- Always say if your making assumptions
- Info-graphic
	- Find a good one
	- Test the infographic on people

Avoid direct quoting
avoid copy and pasting at all costs
provide a citation even after you put it in your own words
