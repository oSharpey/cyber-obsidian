# Attack Modelling Techniques (AMT)
- Constructed using a combination of shapes such as cirlces, ellipses and rectangles to cyber
- Preconditions - conditions that must exist for an exploit to be successful
- Exploits - Could be anything talked about in previous lecture, always result in a new condition called a "post-condition"
- Arcs connecting preconditions mean that both conditions have to exist for an exploit to succeed 
- Rectangle - Precondition
- Ellipses - Exploit
- Post-condition is result of the exploit 
- Going to look at:
	- Cyber kill chain
	- Attack graph
	- Attack tree
	- Fault tree
- AMTs can determine attack probabili
