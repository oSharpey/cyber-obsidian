# Attack Modelling Techniques (AMT)
- Constructed using a combination of shapes such as circles, ellipses and rectangles to cyber-attack constructs

## Attack Constructs 
- Preconditions - conditions that must exist for an exploit to be successful
- Exploits - Could be anything talked about in previous lecture, always result in a new condition called a "post-condition"
- Arcs connecting preconditions mean that both conditions have to exist for an exploit to succeed 
- Rectangle - Precondition
- Ellipses - Exploit
- Post-condition is result of the exploit 
- Going to look at:
	- Cyber kill chain
	- Attack graph
	- Attack tree
	- Fault tree
- AMTs can determine attack probability - used for risk management to weigh up different risks from different preconditions
- Can be used in forensic investigation
- Combination of preconditions and exploits is a goal - goal is also a precondition 

# Jeep Cherokee Hack
- If you have paid subscription 
	- WIFI password can be brute forced because it is generated before the date and time is set
	- Means there are a very small amount of passwords to brute force 
- Also able to connect via sprint network and Sierra wireless Celluar Unit

- Once connected they were able to reflash the the Renesas V850 and jailbreak the system through a frimware over the air update ()
