>  \citet{cryptography4020015} reviews the past two decades of research into power analysis side channel attacks, focusing on introducing these ideas to new researchers in the field. The authors discuss the advancements made, starting with SPA and then covering more advanced methods like DPA, which utilises statistical analysis of power traces to derive a key, and CPA, which builds on DPA by correlating power traces to a hypothetical power model of the device. Additionally, Template Attacks (TA) and Mutual Information Analysis (MIA) are covered. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of a wide range of power analysis techniques. However, with this broad overview, the authors fail to cover practical implementations of these attacks - showing how these vulnerabilities manifest in real-world devices.
