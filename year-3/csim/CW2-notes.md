## Interview statements
### Not interested in images like that
- Google searches for spiderman images
- Downloads for spiderman images 
- Emails between suspect, Jenny and dinny
### There must have been malware
### Would have deleted them straight away

### Never been in contact with people who like those things
- Emails showing distribution of images via wetransfer
- Emails regarding going to meetings about SM (spiderman) images

## Analysis
### Images
- 116 Category A images
- 187 Category B images
- This is not an exhaustive list of images, enough were identified in order to prosecute 
- Found in these locations mainly 
	- `/img_Radovan-Marc-Andran.img/vol_vol2/$RECYCLE_BIN/S-1-5-21-2189243936-2770537914-435387343-1001`

	- `/img_Radovan-Marc-Andran.img/vol_vol2/Users/vboxuser/Desktop/myphhotos/`
- Arrested in September, images have been present in downloads since beginning of august, in myphotos since end of july
- Google searches for 
	- `spiderman`
	- `spiderman photos`
	- `spiderman photos new`
- Provenance of the images can be tracked to actions taken by the user
	- Downloads of zip files containing hundreds of spiderman photos each 
	- 

### Emails
- Found suspicious emails from Andran and Radovan
- Andran emails seems related to drugs, with drops and references to grams and dealing
- Radovan emailing various accounts about:
	- SM meet
	- numbers of photos
	- emailing wetransfer links for zip folders found on the system containing spiderman photos


### Malware
- There are 2 malicious files on the PC in LucusPics
- I do not believe this provides a defence
	- First communication regarding spiderman photos was before these files were on the system
	- No evidence that these files were executed on the PC
	- Registry keys that the malware is known to set are not changed on the system
- It is of my opinion that
