# Software vulnerabilities

## Definitions
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness, or flaw, in software, a system
or process. An attacker may seek to exploit a vulnerability
to gain unauthorised access to a system.
- **Zero-day**: Recently discovered vulnerabilities (or bugs),
not yet known to vendors or antivirus companies, that
hackers can exploit.

## Why do we need to know 
- Software developer
	- To write better code.
	- To make informed decisions about how to avoid vulnerabilities in our code.
- Security advisor or auditor
	- To ask the right questions of the development team.
	- To advise on decisions made by the development team.
	- To advise on which choices are likely to lead to more secure software.
- Penetration tester
	- To exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to systems during a test.

## Factors of Risk
- Language (or type of language).
- Functions, techniques or components to use, to implement particular concepts.
- Choice of how individual functionality has been written in the code.
- The architecture of the operating system also impacts the likelihood of vulnerabilities.
