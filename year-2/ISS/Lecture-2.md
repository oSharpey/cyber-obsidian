# Hash Functions

- Hashing is based on a one-way mathematical function that is relatively easy to compute, but significantly harder to reverse
- It takes a variable-length block of data and produces a fixed length hash value, called the hash
- Every time the data is altered, the hash value also changes

## Features of Hash Function
- The input can be any length 
- The output has a fixed length 
- H(x) is relatively easy to compute for a given x 
- H(x) is one-way and not reversible 
- H(x) is collision-free, meaning that two different input values will result in different hash values
