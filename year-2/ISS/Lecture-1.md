# Cryptography

## What is Cryptography
- Securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format

## Fundamental Concepts
- **Confidentiality**
	- Keeping info secure from unauthed users
- **Integrity**
	- Data remaining unaltered 
- **Non-Repudiation**
- **Trust**
	- Confidence in a system
- **Secrets and Keys**
- **Identity**
	- Need to verify who we are communicating with (certs)
- **Certificates**
- **Randomness and Entropy**
	- Using these to not be predicted

## Why we need cryptography
### Challenges in communication
- Eavesdropping
- Message Alteration
- Impersonation
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- Replay attacks
- Password attacks
- Etcâ€¦

### Example 1 - Eavesdropping
- Unautherized parties intercepting messages
- Compromises confidentiality

### Example 2 - Message Altertion
- Tampering with data during transmission
-
