# Risk Assessment

## Risk Identification
1. identify the organisation’s information assets,
2. classify them,
3. categorize them into useful groups, and
4. prioritize them by overall importance

- Risk assessment must produce results that:
	- are meaningful,
	- a high degree of confidence can be placed.
	- Risk assessment is based on probabilities

- The confidence depends on the accuracy of the data input to the process and on its robustness

## Identifying Hardware, Software and Network Assets
- Can be automated or manual
	- Inventory process requires certain amount of planning
- We need to record relevant attributes for each asset
	- Physical location is important
