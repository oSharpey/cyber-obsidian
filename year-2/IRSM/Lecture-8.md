# Risk Assessment

## Risk Identification
1. identify the organisation’s information assets,
2. classify them,
3. categorize them into useful groups, and
4. prioritize them by overall importance

- Risk assessment must produce results that:
	- are meaningful,
	- a high degree of confidence can be placed.
	- Risk assessment is based on probabilities

- The confidence depends on the accuracy of the data input to the process and on its robustness

## Typical Assets

## Identifying Hardware, Software and Network Assets
- Can be automated or manual
	- Inventory process requires certain amount of planning
- We need to record relevant attributes for each asset
	- Physical location is important
- Determine which attributes of each of these information assets should be tracked, which will depend on the needs of the organisation and its risk management efforts

- Potential asset attributes
	-  Name
	- Asset tag
	- IP address
	- MAC address
	- Asset type
	- Serial number
	- Manufacturer name
	- Manufacturer’s model or part number
	- Software version, update revision, or FCO number
	- Physical location
	- Logical location
	- Controlling entity

## Identifying People, Procedures, and Data Assets
- Identifying, describing and evaluating these information assets should be assigned to managers who posses the necessary knowledge, experience and judgement
- Assets should be recorded via a reliable data handling process

**Potential asset attributes**
- People
	- Position name/number/ID
	- Supervisor name/number/ID
	- Security clearance level
	- Special skills
- Procedures
	- Description
	- Intended purpose
	- Software/hardware/networking elements to which it is tied
	- Location where procedure documents are stored for reference
	- Location where documents are stored for update purposes
- Data
	- Classification
	- Owner/creator/manager
	- Size of data structure
	- Data organization used
	- Online or offline
	- Physical Location
	- Media access method
	- Backup procedures

## Classifying and Categorising Information Assets
- Once the initial inventory is assembled, determine whether its asset categories are meaningful to the RM program
- Inventory should also reflect sensitivity and security priority assigned to each information asset
-  A data classification scheme should be developed that categorises these information assets based on their sensitivity and security needs
- Each of these categories designates the level of protection needed for a particular information asset
- Classification categories must be comprehensive and mutually exclusive

## Asset Classification Scheme

## Rank Ordering Information Assets
- The final step in the risk identification process is to prioritise, or rank order, the assets
	- weighted table analysis
	- method of valuing information assets by ranking various assets based on criteria specified by the organisation
- More straightforward than a raw estimation based on some other more ambiguous assessment

# Threat Assessment
A threat assessment is a statement of threats that are related to vulnerabilities of company assets and threat agents, and also a statement of the believed capabilities that those threat agents possess.
-  Discovering and assessing the motivation, capability, opportunity, and impact that threat agents may pose.
-  Given the nature of the business, threats will be known and understood, even if the events associated with the threats cannot be predicted or measured in quite the same way as risk.
**Threat:** A circumstance or event that has the potential to cause harm by violating security


## The Overall Process
1. Threat assessment
	- Likelihood estimation
	- Severity prediction
2. Asset evaluation (importance, exposure, attractiveness)
	- Vulnerability assessment
3. Impact assessment
	- Threat & asset interaction
4. Safeguard evaluation

- Reactive method, it needs history data for the threats.
