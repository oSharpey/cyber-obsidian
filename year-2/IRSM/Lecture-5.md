# Risk management & Governance 

## Risk Definition
- Risk is the probability that a threat agent (cause) will exploit a system vulnerability (weakness) and thereby create an effect detrimental to the system
- A risk represents the likelihood of a threat happening/causing a problem

## Risk management
- Risk management is the process of discovering and assessing the risks to an organisation’s operations and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated
- This process involves discovering and understanding answers to some key questions about the risk associated with an organisation’s information assets:
	- Risk Identifcation
	- Risk Analysis
	- Risk Evaluatuin
	- Risk Treatment

Risk mangement is made up of 2 areas, **Risk Assessment** & **Risk Conrol**
- **Risk Assessment** - Identify and analyse the risks
- **Risk Control** - Reduce risk and provide contingency

## Standards for Risk management
### ISO 27005 - 5 Stages
- Risk Assessment
- Risk Treatment
- Risk Acceptacne
- Risk Communication
- Risk monitoring and reviuw

ISO 27005 is specific to cyber security risk management

### ISO 31000
- provides a structured methodology for evaluating threats to economic performance in an organization

- Current version ITIL 4 was launched in February 2019.
- supported by ISO/IEC 20000:2022 - International standard for ITSM
### COBIT - Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology
- Addresses regulatory compliance, risk management and aligning IT strategy with organisational goals.

-  Principles
	1. Meeting stakeholder needs
	2. Covering the enterprise end to end

## Risk Management Methodolgies
### NIST Risk Management Framework
1. Frame risk or establish a risk context describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made
2. Assess risk within the context of the organisational risk frame
3. Respond to risk once that risk is determined based on the results of risk assessments
4. Monitor risk over time
