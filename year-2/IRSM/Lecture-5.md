# Risk management & Governance 

## Risk Definition
- Risk is the probability that a threat agent (cause) will exploit a system vulnerability (weakness) and thereby create an effect detrimental to the system
- A risk represents the likelihood of a threat happening/causing a problem

## Risk management
- Risk management is the process of discovering and assessing the risks to an organisation’s operations and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated
- This process involves discovering and understanding answers to some key questions about the risk associated with an organisation’s information assets:
	- Risk Identification
	- Risk Analysis
	- Risk Evaluation
	- Risk Treatment

Risk management is made up of 2 areas, **Risk Assessment** & **Risk Control**
- **Risk Assessment** - Identify and analyse the risks
- **Risk Control** - Reduce risk and provide contingency

## Standards for Risk management
### ISO 27005 - 5 Stages
- Risk Assessment
- Risk Treatment
- Risk Acceptance
- Risk Communication
- Risk monitoring and review

ISO 27005 is specific to cyber security risk management

### ISO 31000
- provides a structured methodology for evaluating threats to economic performance in an organization

## Governance
- the way in which an organisation is managed at the highest level, and the systems for doing this
-  Governance of information security is a strategic planning responsibility

## IS/IT Governance Frameworks and Models

### ISO/IEC 38500:2015 - Governance of IT for the organization
- international standard for the corporate governance of information technology
### ISO/IEC 27014:2020 - Governance of information security
- The standard specifies six high-level “action-oriented” information security governance objective
### ITIL- IT service management
- framework for IT service management
- Current version ITIL 4 was launched in February 2019.
- supported by ISO/IEC 20000:2022 - International standard for ITSM
### COBIT - Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology
- Addresses regulatory compliance, risk management and aligning IT strategy with organisational goals.
- COBIT 5 was released in 2012
-  Principles
	1. Meeting stakeholder needs
	2. Covering the enterprise end to end
	3. Applying a single integrated framework
	4. Enabling a holistic approach
	5. Separating governance from management

| --- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D**   | **Diagnosing**   | **Determine where you are relative to where you want to be**                                  |
| **E**   | **Establishing** | **Plan the specifics of how you will reach your destination**                                 |
| **A**   | **Acting**      | **Do the work according to the plan**                                                         |
| **L**   | **Learning**     | **Learn from the experience and improve you ability to adopt new improvements in the future** |


## Approaching Risk Management

## Risk Management Methodolgies
### NIST Risk Management Framework
1. Frame risk or establish a risk context describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made
2. Assess risk within the context of the organisational risk frame
3. Respond to risk once that risk is determined based on the results of risk assessments
4. Monitor risk over time

### NIST Tiered risk management approach

### OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)
essential components of a comprehensive, systematic, context-
driven, self-directed information security risk evaluation
![[octave.png]]

### Microsoft’s risk management guide
1. Assessing risk
2. Conducting decision support
3. Implementing controls
4. Measuring program effectiveness

### Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)
- What the major known risks are
- Which of these risks will limit the ability of the organisation to complete its mission
- What plans are in place to deal with risks
- Who owns the management and monitoring of these risks

## Information Security Governance Maturity
- Information Security Maturity and Governance Maturity models have been developed to aid in the measurement of Cyber Security effectiveness
	- enable organisations to identify where their practices are weak or not taken seriously and where their practices are truly embedded
	- There are different models and frameworks to measure an organisation’s maturity level
-  Maturity assessments allow organisations to improve in areas with low score ratings/ underdeveloped processes
