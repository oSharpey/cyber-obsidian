# Cybercrime

## What is a crime
1. **uncountable** activities that involve breaking the law
2. **countable** crime (against somebody) an illegal act or activity that can be punished by law

## Cyber Crime Definitions
1. Cybercrime is an act that ***violates the law****, which is perpetrated using ***information and communication technology*** (ICT) to either target networks, systems, data, websites and/or technology or facilitate a crime
2. Offences against the ***confidentiality, integrity and availability*** of computer information and systems.

| Classification | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| Cyber Dependant |any crime that can only be committed using computers,computer networks or other forms of information communication technology            |
| Cyber Enabled | traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technologies

## Traditional vs Cyber Crime
- Traditional crimes acquired a new dimension in the cyber world
- Computers can be tool or target of criminal activity

Characteristics:
- Offline traditional crimes (EC3, 2014):
	- Criminals typically have to be present at the crime scene
	- Criminals typically can only commit one offence at a time
- Cybercrimes:
	- Criminals do not need to be close to the crime scene
	- Criminals may never even travel to the target location
	- Criminals can attack a large number of victims globally
	- Criminals commit crime with minimum effort & risk

## Anatomy of Cyber Crime
- MOMM Acronym
	- Motivation: 
		- Money, Ideology, Egotism
	- Opportunity
		- Knowledge, Access
	- Means
		- Purpose
	- Method
		- Interception
		- Forgery

## Taxonomy of Cyberciminals
- Characterising criminals based off motives and skills
- Novice
	- For media attention
	- Little technical skills
	- "Script kiddies"
- Cyber-Punks
	- Cyber vandals
	- Some skills
- Internals
	- Disgruntled employees
	- sometimes computer literate
	- Sometimes accidentally release data
- Professional Criminals
	- Motivated by profit
	- Highly skilled
	- Guns for hire
- Cyber terrorists (State actors)
	- Motivated by ideals
	- Highly skilled, well-trained
	- Well funded
	- Political activists


## Adversary model of Cyber crime
- Once you become a target, an attacker will find a way in
- When we calculate risk, no matter how you build up a system, once you become a target there will be a way in

## Types of Cyber crime

### Cyber Enabled Crimes
- Traditional types of crimes that have been transformed with the use of tech
	- Computer-related fraud or forgery
	- Computer-related identity offences
	- Sending or controlling sending of spam
	- Computer-related copyright or trademark offences
	- Computer-related acts causing personal harm
	- Computer-related solicitation or "grooming" of children
- Lauri Love - before the case there was no legislation to give up your password when arrested
- Now it is a legal requirement

### Cyber Dependant Crimes
#### Cyber-Attack (Hacking)
*Profit, protest, or challenge*
- An intrusion into a computer system/network
- 
- Hacker:
	- Bypasses systemâ€™s access controls 
	- Takes advantage of security weaknesses 
	- knowledgeable and skilled
**Black hat**: break into computer systems or use them without authorization
**Grey hat**: walk the line between legal and illegal actions
**White hat**: employed to break security to expose vulnerability

*Network Enumeration* - Research the target
*Vulnerability analysis* - How to attack the target
*Exploitation* - Compromise the system
*Persistence* - Gain a foothold in the system

#### DOS/DDOS
- Main aims:
	- Cause disruption
	- Deny access to resources
	- Gives attacks an opportunity to infiltrate what they want in the system
	- Gives them space to access different types of resources
- Motives
	- Prevention of legitimate network traffic
	- Disruption of service
	- Access prevention
	- Accessibility prevention

#### Malicious Software
- Started as a prank that causes little harm
- Transformed into malware that is highly disruptive
- Causes extortion, financial gain, loss of data, loss of business

## Who is Combating Cyber Crime
- Government agencies
	- Local police forces
	- National Crime Agency (NCA)
	- Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP)
	- National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
	- National Protective Security Authority (NPSA)
	- Government Departments

- Most of the work being done by NCA and NCSC (GCHQ).

## Challenges in combating cyber crime
- Technical
	- attribution
	-  vulnerabilities
	- virtualised infrastructure
- Legal
	- transnational crime
	- different legal systems between countries
	- variations in national cybercrime laws
	- differences in the rules of evidence and criminal procedure
	- variations in the scope and geographic applicability of regional and multilateral cybercrime treaties
	- differences in approaches to data protection and respect for human rights.
- Ethical
	- refraining from harming others, systems, and data, and respecting the rule of law and human rights
- Operational
	- Cooperation with other countries

### Cyber Crime sees no boundaries
- Trans national
- Different legal systems
- Different laws, court system
- No matter how many international efforts taking place its very difficult to overcome
- Ethical challenges: What is considered to be legal and what is not
	- Cambridge analytica
- Operational
	- how do companies corporate
	- How do they recover and prevent cyber attacks
## Findings and recommendations
- Attacks using commonly available cybercrime tools appear to be more likely, and easier to achieve
	- Lowers the bar of entry
	- Gives an easy opportunity for someone to take and use
- Malware developers are increasingly relying on social engineering, spam botnets, and other infection methods
	- Technical defences are getting more advanced
	- Easier to use ready made tools
- Law enforcement must continue to
	- Focus on threat actors providing attack tools and services
	- Attempting to prevent malware and distribution of malware
	- get private sector to continue threat analysis
	- Build trusted relationships internationally. Be current and relevant with new technology
	- Develop strategies, prevention and awareness campaigns, educate the public to recognise threats
