In brief, calculating a metric for the impact and likelihood of an event happening

TODO: slide 4
## Aggregation 

For small/medium businesses RM can be overwhelming, aggregation can be used to mitigate this.

This is the grouping of assets, threats and their risks into more general categoires.

# Types of Analysis Method

- Quantitative
	- mathematical approach to the problem. 
	- measure the amount of damage done to an asset because of a compromise
	- identifies probabilities
- Qualitative
	- estimated potential loss is used
	- “high”, “medium”, and “low”
	- involves less uncertainty 
	- considers the knowledge and the judgements of those doing the analysis. 
- Knowledge-Based
	- reusing “best practice” from similar systems
- Model-Based
	- object-oriented modelling to describe and analyse the risk

## Quantitative Example

# Risk Metrics

$risk = (likelihood * impact) \pm uncertainty$

### Uncertainty

TODO ask what this is with respect to

An estimate made with respect to controls
The degree to which a current control can reduce risk
### Impact
what?
### Likelihood
Depends on the value of information and motivation of the attacker

Attacker will be present in some form, except for environmental hazards, errors and failures

# Risk evaluation and treatment
Each organization must determine its risk appetite during risk evaluation.

Assets with unacceptable levels of risk are treated using one of five strategies:
- **Defence**: Preventing the exploitation of a vulnerability
- **Transference**: Shifting risk to another entity 
- **Mitigation**: Planning and prep to reduce the impact or potential consequences of an incident
- **Acceptance**: Do nothing beyond current protections
- **Termination**: Organisations intentional choice not to protect an asset

## Mitigation Plan Example

## Managing the risk
- Risk appetite is the quantity and nature of risk that organisations are willing to accept as they evaluate the trade-offs between perfect security and unlimited accessibility
	- A reasoned approach balances the expense against the possible losses, if exploited
	- When vulnerabilities have been controlled to the degree possible, there is often remaining risk that has not been completely removed, shifted, or planned for— residual risk

### Residual Risk
- Often there is some remaining risk that has not been completely removed, shifted, or planned for
- Residual risk persists even after safeguards are implemented
