# Lecture 1

## Why do we need to manage risk and information security?
- We cannot say any system is 100% secure and bulletproof

## Events that changed how information security was manages
- 2007: HMRC lost 2 HDDs containing all child benifit records, contained the personal details of 25 million people
	- Human error
- 2009: USB stick containing medical records for 6000 prisoners was lost from HMP Preston

## The reason
 - Most of an organisations assets are digital
 - We need to put measures in place to help reduce the risk of threats against a system - to a level that is acceptable
 -  The critical processes depend on IT but there is still a human element
	 - You still need someone monitoring the system
- Impact of technology innovations in information security 
	- Moving very fast - little time to catch up
	- High virtual dependency

## Setting the scene
- We need to distinguish cyber attacks we see
	- Destructive - Not a high level of expertise, 
	- meaningful - require a high level of expertise, most cases come from within the organisation
		- People in the organisation know how things work, have access to systems, escalate privileges
		- Also state actors
		- The attackers will get in - only a matter of time

## What is the system
- items with common characteristics
- could be the set that comprises an organisations assets
- Define the countries of the system
	- Who has and how do we share responsibility
	- Control
	- Who are and what are the roles of the involved parties

## Task

	- Any potentially nefarious/unwanted/vulnerable usage of a system
- Risk Management
	- Implementing controls/procedures/policies to mitigate and minimise risk to a system
