# Lecture 1

## Why do we need to manage risk and information security?
- We cannot say any system is 100% secure and bulletproof

## Events that changed how information security was manages
- 2007: HMRC lost 2 HDDs containing all child benifit records, contained the personal details of 25 million people
	- Human error
- 2009: USB stick containing medical records for 6000 prisoners was lost from HMP Preston

## The reason
 - Most of an organisations assets are digital
 - We need to put measures in place to help reduce the risk of threats against a system - to a level that is acceptable
 -  The critical processes depend on IT but there is still a human element
	 - You still need someone monitoring the system
- Impact of technology innovations in information security
