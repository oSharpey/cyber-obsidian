# Introduction

## Learning outcomes
1. Develop an understanding on adopting a responsible attitude to the social, ethical, legal and regulatory
consequences that flow from professional engagement in security management.
2. Apply a relevant risk management approach to a given organisation or scenario.
3. Analyse the organisational consequences that result from inadequate information risk management.
4. Evaluate the overall coherence of an organisation's management of cyber security, recommending
remediation where needed.

# Lecture 1

## Why do we need to manage risk and information security?
- We cannot say any system is 100% secure and bulletproof

## Events that changed how information security was manages
- 2007: HMRC lost 2 HDDs containing all child benifit records, contained the personal details of 25 million people
	- Human error
- 2009: USB stick containing medical records for 6000 prisoners was lost from HMP Preston

## The reason
 - Most of an organisations assets are digital
 - We need to put measures in place to help reduce the risk of threats against a system - to a level that is acceptable
 -  The critical processes depend on IT but there is still a human element
	 - You still need someone monitoring the system
- Impact of technology innovations in information security 
	- Moving very fast - little time to catch up
	- High virtual dependency

## Setting the scene
- We need to distinguish cyber attacks we see
	- Destructive - Not a high level of expertise, 
	- meaningful - require a high level of expertise, most cases come from within the organisation
		- People in the organisation know how things work, have access to systems, escalate privileges
		- Also state actors
		- The attackers will get in - only a matter of time

## What is the system
- items with common characteristics
- could be the set that comprises an organisations assets
- Define the countries of the system
	- Who has and how do we share responsibility
	- Control
	- Who are and what are the roles of the involved parties

## Task
- **Risk**
	- Any potentially nefarious/unwanted/vulnerable usage of a system
- **Risk Management**
	- Mitigating and minimising risk to a system
- **Information Risk Management**
	- How do you implement controls/procedures/policies. Apply risk management techniques to data.
- **Risk Identification**
	- Going through your systems to assess and audit your systems. What risks are relevant to your data
- **Risk Treatment***
	- How you respond to and mitigate the risk. Security controls, new policy. How do we apply controls and how do we write effective policy

## Threat
- *A circumstance or event that has the potential to cause harm by violating security*
- A threat will be identified if we see a vulnerablity or weakness on our system
- Factors to employ a threat: 
	- **Motivation** is the degree to which an agent is prepared to implement a threat. Is it an opportunity or targeted
	- **Capability** is the degree to which an aggressor is able to implement a threat. Different capability based on expertise
	- **Opportunity** is the degree to which the target presents a likelihood of attack. Human error, social engineering, a specific type of attack?
	- **Impact** is the degree the result of the threat will influence the target (minor, moderate, major, catastrophic)

## Information Security threats
- Interception
- Interruption
- Modification
- Fabrication


## Understating the solution
- **CIA** of an organisations data
	- Assets, operations, and information
- Extends to four human-oriented security aspects 
	- Responsibility 
	- Integrity 
	- Trust 
	- Ethicality
### Umbrella of terms
- Information Security governance
- Information Security Management
- Information Risk Management

## Information Security Purpose 
Protection of the following assets 
- Hardware 
- Software 
- Communication equipment 
- Environmental control equipment 
- Documentation 
- Data and information 
- Personnel 
…of an Information System

**PREVENTION - DETECTION - RESPONSE**

## CIA Triad
- CIA might not be enough
- Standard extended to include *Authenticity*, *Accountability*, *Non-Repudiation*
- Authenticity
	- Providing verification of identities

## Properties of Information security
- Reliability
- Availability
- Safety
- Integrity
- Confidentiality
- Privacy

## Measures that can enforce CIA
- Confidentiality
	- Password protection
	- Encryption
	- SSL
	- VPN
- Integrity
	- CRC
	- Digital Signing
	- Hashes
- Availability 
	- AV software
	- Hot/Cold Sites
	- Insurance 
	- Backups

## Risk Management
- Risk management is the process of discovering and assessing the risks to an organisation’s operations and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated
- Not only about the data perspective
	- Look at bigger picture
	- Can impact other entities - People, property, etc

**Risk identification** • Where and what is the risk? 
**Risk analysis** • How severe is the current level of risk? 
**Risk evaluation** • Is the current level of risk acceptable? 
**Risk treatment** • What do I need to do to bring the risk to an acceptable level?
