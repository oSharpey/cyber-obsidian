## Vulnerabilities 

**Microsoft Server 2022 (build 10.0.20348.1787):**

- **Active Directory:** Active Directory is a critical component of many IT infrastructures, and it is therefore a common target for attackers. Some of the most common Active Direcoh thtory vulnerabilities include:

> - **SambaCry:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to gain remote code execution on systems running Samba, a software package that provides file and printer sharing services for Linux and Unix systems.
> - **CVE-2023-1675:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to gain remote code execution on systems running Windows Server 2022.

- **Domain Name System (DNS):** DNS is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses, which computers use to communicate with each other. DNS vulnerabilities can be exploited to redirect traffic to malicious websites or to steal user credentials. Some of the most common DNS vulnerabilities include:

> - **DNS cache poisoning:** This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate the DNS cache of a victim's computer, causing it to resolve legitimate domain names to malicious IP addresses.
> - **DNSSEC misconfiguration:** This vulnerability can occur when DNSSEC is not properly configured, which can allow attackers to spoof DNS records and redirect traffic to malicious websites.

- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):** DHCP is responsible for assigning IP addresses to devices on a network. DHCP vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a network or to disrupt network traffic. Some of the most common DHCP vulnerabilities include:

> - **DHCP spoofing:** This vulnerability allows attackers to impersonate a DHCP server and assign malicious IP addresses to devices on a network.
> - **DHCP starvation:** This vulnerability allows attackers to deplete the DHCP pool of available IP addresses, which can disrupt network connectivity for legitimate users.

**Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Cloud application:**

- **Oracle WebLogic Server:** Oracle WebLogic Server is a Java application server that is used by the Oracle ERP Cloud application. Several vulnerabilities have been found in Oracle WebLogic Server, including:

> - **CVE-2023-3763:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to gain remote code execution on systems running Oracle WebLogic Server.
> - **CVE-2023-3762:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to Oracle WebLogic Server.

**Apache Server:**

- **Apache HTTP Server:** Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server that is used to host websites. Several vulnerabilities have been found in Apache HTTP Server, including:

> - **CVE-2023-4473:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running Apache HTTP Server.
> - **CVE-2023-4375:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to steal sensitive information from systems running Apache HTTP Server.

**Adobe Reader:**

- **Adobe Reader:** Adobe Reader is a popular PDF viewer that is often used in enterprise environments. Several vulnerabilities have been found in Adobe Reader, including:

> - **CVE-2023-3913:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running Adobe Reader.
> - **CVE-2023-3914:** This vulnerability allowed attackers to steal sensitive information from systems running Adobe Reader.

In addition to these specific vulnerabilities, there are also a number of general security risks associated with the technology stack you described. These risks include:

- **Outdated software:** Many of the software packages listed in your description are out of date, which means that they may contain vulnerabilities that have not been patched.
- **Weak passwords:** Many users are still using weak passwords, which makes it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems.
- **Lack of security awareness:** Many users are not aware of the security risks associated with their online activities, which can make them more susceptible to phishing attacks and other social engineering techniques.

To mitigate these risks, it is important to implement a comprehensive security strategy that includes the following measures:

- **Regularly update software:** All software should be updated to the latest version as soon as possible.
- **Use strong passwords:** All passwords should be at least 12 characters long and should contain a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Be aware of social engineering attacks:** Users should be educated about the risks of phishing attacks and other social engineering techniques.
- **Use multi-factor authentication:** Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional verification, such as a code from their phone, in addition to their password.

By implementing these measures, you can help to protect your organization from a variety of security risks.



As the company is looking to work on UK Government contracts it is a priority that the risk assessment framework allows for the company to be compliant with all applicable government regulations, specifically Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus which is needed for a company to work with certain UK Government contracts. There are a number of existing risk management and risk assessment frameworks to allow the organisation to properly identify and manage
