Google password manager 
Usage Scenarios 
- A user revisiting a website having the password manager auto-fill logins
- A user wanting to save a login for a newly created account
- A user wanting to generate a strong and unique password 

Threat Scenario
- A user autofilling a password on a phishing website gaining access to the users personal data
- Having passwords synced over multiple devices increases the possibility of having a password compromised - more devices you can leave unlocked 
- A user choosing a weak easy to remember master password that is easily found in a wordlist

easy of use of threat scenarios
As stated in the paper users follow the path of least resistance, this can expose many threat scenarios for a user unintentionally break a system or expose themselves to threats. 

The autofilling feature on the google password manager creates an easy way for a user to log in to sites with the least mental effort possible, this also exposes a risk for a user not paying due attention and auto filling a password into a phishing website. 

It is also very easy for a user to get confused and not understand the importance of generating unique passwords for every website so the user may end up reusing the same passwords for websites

The feature of syncing passwords across multiple devices leads to more of a chance a user accidentally leaves a device open and unlocked allowing a threat actor to read their passwords 

Difficulty of use for usage scenarios
How easy is it to autofill a login, occasionally when autofilling passwords for revisited websites the password manager may fill the wrong information in the wrong fields causing more mental effort for the user having to fill the information manually

Saving a login for a  newly created account, user is prompted to save the password however some sites use a separate domain for creating an account and logging in which causes the autofill feature not to work

Similar to the threat scenario above a user may be confused about seeing a long random string of characters leading them to ignore the generate password feature

Recommendations
- Have the password manager session automatically log out after a specific amount of time to reduce the risk of password being exposed by leaving a device unlocked
- Have a more prominent password health section to warn the user of reused passwords and prompts to change them
- Educate users on phishing and provide phishing warnings to prevent autofilling on compromised websites
