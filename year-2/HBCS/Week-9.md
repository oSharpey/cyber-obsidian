# Usability with users

## Usability Testing
**Formative Testing** - Thinking out loud
**Summative Testing** - Measurement test

There are large differences across users so a small sample size can still be useful to find issues

## Formula for finding of usability problems
$f(i) = N(1 - A^i)$
- $f(i)$ = The usability problems found
- $i$ = the number of test users, 
- $N$ = the total number of usability problems in the interface.
- $A$ = the probability for finding any single problem with any single test user.

## Choosing Users - Key issues
- Setting Goals
- Identifying Participants
- Relationship with participants
- Triangulation
- Pilot Studies

## The System Usability Scale (Brooke, 1996)
- Likely the most popular standardised mixed-tone questionnaire for the assessment of perceived usability.
	- The odd-numbered items have a positive tone; the even-numbered items - a negative tone.
- Range from 0 (a poor experience) to 4 (a good experience).
- Odd numbers - the score contribution is the scale position minus 1.
- Even numbers - the score contribution is 5 minus the scale position.
- To get the overall SUS score, multiply the sum of the item score contributions by 2.5.
	- Score range from 0 (very poor perceived usability) to 100 (excellent perceived usability) in 2.5-point increments.
