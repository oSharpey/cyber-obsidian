# Usability vs Security: Part 2

## Approach II
- Sasse et al. (2001):
	- Focus on passwords
	- Problems happen due to how current passwords are implemented
- Secure Design Issues:
	1. Technology
	2. User
	3. Goals and tasks
	4. Context

## Passwords
- Majority of people reuse passwords across accounts
- Most security breaches due to passwords

## Technology
- Passwords are low cost
- Users are familiar with it
- Issues:
	- Number of passwords a user has
	- Different password policies
	- Varying system requirements
- Huge demand on users memory
#### Solutions
- Single Sign On
	- Reduces memory load and login times
- Single User ID for all systems
- Standardising password rules

## Users
- Memorability the primary impact on password design
	- Capacity of working memory is limited
	- Memory decays over time
	- Frequently recalled items are easier to remember
	- Words are easier to recall than an random string of letters and numbers

#### Techniques and alternatives
- Recalling strong passwords is a humanly impossible task.
	- Concatenating several words together
	- Systems based on recognition of visual items for authentication:
		- v-GO®; Déjà vu; PassfacesTM.

## Goals and tasks
- Technology must work with users to achieve their goals
- User and system interaction should be efficient
- Principles of good design:
	- Fundamental tasks should be given priority
	- Frequent tasks should be efficient
	- Tasks should be in line with their strengths and weaknesses  (e.g., limitations of human memory)

## Users problems with security
- Users are goal driven
