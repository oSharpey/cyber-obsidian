# Usability vs Security: Part 2

## Approach II
- Sasse et al. (2001):
	- Focus on passwords
	- Problems happen due to how current passwords are implemented
- Secure Design Issues:
	1. Technology
	2. User
	3. Goals and tasks
	4. Context

## Passwords
- Majority of people reuse passwords across accounts
- Most security breaches due to passwords

## Technology
