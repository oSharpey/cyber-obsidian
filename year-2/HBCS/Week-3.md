# Lecture 3 - Human Computer Interaction

## What is HCI 
- A discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them

## Goals of HCI
- Develop systems in terms of :
	- Safety
	- Utility
	- Effectiveness
	- Efficiency
	- Usability
- People should come first
	- The should not fir "in with the system" but systems should be designed to match users design requirements

## Principles of HCI
- Focus on humans.
- Focus on the right problem, not the symptoms.
- Everything is connected.
- Keep the big picture in mind.

## Conceptual Model for HCI
- Level 1: Humans
- Level 2: Physical Environment
- Level 3: Technology

## Designing HCI
- Involving users.
- Integrating different kinds of knowledge and expertise.
- Making the design process iterative.
	- Based on the STAR Life Cycle.
	- Constant evaluation by users and experts.

## Ergononimcs
- Fittsâ€™s law (predicts the movement time as a function of the distance to and the size of the target).
- Hick's Law (increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically).
- Yerkes-Dodson Law (performance peaks at a certain level of arousal).
- Motor control (motor-control performances with different devices)

### Fitt's Law
- Proves its faster hit closer larger targets than smaller further targets
### Hicks Law
- Applies to any simple decision with multiple choices
- When response time is critical
- Simplify complex processes
	- Present specific parts of that process at any one time on screen
	- Keep number of options small
	- Highlight important choices

### Yerkes-Dodson Law
- High stress means less performance
- Factors affecting performance
	- Slow changing, repetitive data
	- Boring Tasks
	- Attention Diversion
	- Stress
	- Fatigue
## Cognitive modelling
- One way to evaluate the usability of a product
- Human Processor Model
	- Calculate hoe long it takes to perform a task
- GOMS model (Goals, Operations, Methods, Selection)
	- Produces quantitative and qualitative predictions of how people will use a proposed system
- KLM (Keystroke-level model)
	- The first and simplest GOMS technique.

- GOMS MHP KLM introduced in 1983
	- Tasks decomposed into millisecond level actions

### MHP
- The analogy between human and computer functioning.
- Simple aspects of perception, attention, short-term memory operations, planning, and motor behaviour in a single model.
- Accounting for basic human processing requirements in order to optimise performance.
- For some tasks humans respond like a serial processor
- Sometimes parallel operation of the 3 tasks takes place
- Uses experimental time to calculate cognitive and motor processing time
- Breaks does every step of the task

### GOMS
- Earliest theory in HCI
- Is a practical tool
 - Example of GOMS
	 - GOAL - go from hotel to airport
	 - OPERATORS - walk, take bus, drive
	 - METHODS - locate bus stop, wait for bus
	 - SELECTION RULES - Walking is cheaper but slow, Taking bus is complicated abroad

### KLM
- Variation of GOMS
- estimate execution time of a task
- Done by listing the sequence of operators and totalling the execution times for the individual operators
	- *Texecute = TK + TP + TH + TD + TM + TR*
- Four physical-motor operators:
	- K - keystroking/ keypressing
	- P - pointing with a mouse to a target
	- H - homing the hand on the keyboard
	- D - drawing a line segment on a grid
- One mental operator M and a system response operator R:
	-  M stands for the time users have to mentally prepare themselves to do an action.
	-  R stands for the time the user has to wait for the system.
