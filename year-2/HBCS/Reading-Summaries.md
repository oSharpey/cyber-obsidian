- Correlation between mental models and privacy conscious actions is influenced by personal experience.
- 28 person survey, mostly under 30, doesn't represent average internet user.
- Correlation is small and only a few people could make a difference.
- Privacy tools are easier to use compared to 2015
- Q1:
    - People understand that privacy is a concern but do not see themselves as a target,
    - "I've got nothing to hide."
    - Misplaced trust in corporations
    - People seem not to care
- Q2:
    - Need to improve mental models
    - Fundamentals of where data goes
    - Understand how policies influence their data and respond to threats

The paper aims to discuss the possibly that artificial intelligence could overcome humans. It focuses on the shortcomings of current thoughts on AI and humanity being too focused on treating the brain like a computer and input-output relationships. The paper proposes a new way to look at the issue focusing more on the complexities of human consciousness and intelligence, identifying how important creativity, morality, emotion and experiences are integral to being human. The paper presents a new idea on how machines could achieve consciousness, grouping machines into 4 different categories based on 4 different types of cognition, and the author highlights these are needed to surpass human intelligence. finally the paper highlights the implications and paradoxes of having a AI that is conscious and intelligent. If a machine has consciousness can it really be called a computer if it can no longer solve problems accurately. If machines can surpass human intelligence who is smarter, the machine or the human as they built the machine. The paper concludes with the author summarising the paper and saying that the way we will achieve human like consciousness by rejecting the idea brains are like digital computers and instead proposes the machine-like-brain as an alternative for implementing cognition similar to brains. 

Do you agree on the 4 types of 

The paper suggests that the "Super machine" - type 2 cognition would be the only for AI to gain consciousness and surpass humans. Do you agree that AI can truly become conscious or is consciousness only something unique to being human - and if we do ever achieve human consciousness in machines and if a machine develops it own sense of morality how do we ensure they are aligned with human values, what interventions should be in place to prevent AI from surpassing humans

Do you agree with the categories of cognition that the paper suggests we group machines into - do they miss out on some intrinsically human values integral to real consciousness, are they sufficient to develop human intelligence in machines especially considering consciousness and the binding problem

Plan
- Discussion introduction, introduce the paper
- Discuss our general thoughts on the paper, what did we find interesting and what criticisms did we have of the paper
- Discuss the papers conclusion - do we agree on the conclusions of the author about how AI could possibly become conscious 
- Discuss Question 1
- Discuss Question 2
- Space for some further discussion based on points raised by the 2 key questions
- Final summary and closing


-written by one person a little sus

-5 years old , been a lot of development since then byt only in a technological aspect, this focus' on the more absrtact moral concepts

-loose definitions on being and exceeding human metrics

-evolution necessary step???

-sense of morality integral to decsions ,knowing what is a pro and con means they would need to create their own weightings for things they haven't come across before

-would it become conscious or indistinguishable from consicous

-who decides what human morals to imprint on ai

-does it need to reproduce if it can live forever

-who's to say we weren't built by mice?

-what is awareness, it needs to be aware to be conscious how do we know it's not faking it

-is it conscious or cous-cous

-the binding problem, items that are encoded in the brain are combined for one experience

-the human condition is a fucking tragedy

-the paper genralises too much on the definition of being human

-paper discusses two different things , matching the human experience and surpassing humans and discussing them as one misses a lot of nuance from the situation

-as a lesser known technological country , are they motivated to have more wild conclusions to gain noteriety and attention to their technological arm? (chile)

-they think humans are the clever ones, i the notetaker disagree and think the ai is clever

Loss framed messages more effective
Win and lose may not be direct opposites
Marked down for providing address when your'e being presented with a shopping website (may need billing address)
Interesting how they weighted the cyber security behaviour 
passwords should be ranked higher than other factors than sign up
Using comp8 to measure security of passwords not the best way 
Not too much difference between means of suffering cyber attack - would have been different if weighting was different
Mostly common sense
