- Correlation between mental models and privacy conscious actions is influenced by personal experience.

The paper aims to discuss the possibly that artificial intelligence could overcome humans. It focuses on the shortcomings of current thoughts on AI and humanity being too focused on treating the brain like a computer and input-output relationships. The paper proposes a new way to look at the issue focusing more on the complexities of human consciousness and intelligence, identifying how important creativity, morality, emotion and experiences are integral to being human. The paper presents a new idea on how machines could achieve consciousness, grouping machines into 4 different categories based on 4 different types of cognition, and the author highlights these are needed to surpass human intelligence. finally the paper highlights the implications and paradoxes of having a AI that is conscious and intelligent. If a machine has consciousness can it really be called a computer if it can no longer solve problems accurately. If machines can surpass human intelligence who is smarter, the machine or the human as they built the machine. The paper concludes with the author summarising the paper and saying that the way we will achieve human like consciousness by rejecting the idea brains are like digital computers and instead proposes the machine-like-brain as an alternative for implementing cognition similar to brains. 

Do you agree on the 4 types of 

The paper suggests that the "Super machine" - type 2 cognition would be the only for AI to gain consciousness and surpass humans. Do you agree that AI can truly become conscious or is consciousness only something unique to being human - and if we do ever achieve human consciousness in machines and if a machine develops it own sense of morality how do we ensure they are aligned with human values, what interventions should be in place to prevent AI from surpassing humans

Do you agree with the categories of cognition that the paper suggests we group machines into - do they miss out on some intrinsically human values integral to real consciousness, are they sufficient to develop human intelligence in machines especially considering consciousness and the binding problem
