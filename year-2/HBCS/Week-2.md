## Conceptual Model
- A high-level description of how a system is organised and operates. -
- Abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it.

a) First impressions 

Good: 
- Buttons are in comfortable positions, eg the rest under your thumb 
- Layout of lockscreen specifically allows for easy access of important features

c)
Usability goals: 
- Efficient to use: Phone should be smooth and responsive
- Easy to learn: Is the UI Intuitive and easy to interpret?
- Utility: Does the phone perform all the functions it should?

User experice Goals
- Enaging, Entertaining, not overwhelming, comfortable to use

Most Important:
