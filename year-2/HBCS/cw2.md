As artificial intelligence becomes more of a regular feature in modern society it is important to take a step back and assess the possible consequences of this future development. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be classed as a machine or system that is capable of reaching or surpassing human cognitive ability and with the steady advances in the development of this field it is conceivable that this will be reached by the end of the century (CBS, 2023). Signorelli (2018) proposes new ideas on what is needed for a computer to gain human level intelligence, they touch on paradoxes that arise from this idea and ethical concerns that surround creating artificial general intelligence. This essay will dig deeper into these ideas and discuss the moral and ethical consequences that AGI can pose on current and future society, considering the impact on jobs, and how this amplifies societal inequality and cyber security concerns that AI poses on the public.
