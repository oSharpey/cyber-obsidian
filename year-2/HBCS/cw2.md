As artificial intelligence becomes more of a regular feature in modern society it is important to take a step back and assess the possible consequences of this future development. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be classed as a machine or system that is capable of reaching or surpassing human cognitive ability and with the steady advances in the development of this field it is conceivable that this will be reached by the end of the century (CBS, 2023). Signorelli (2018) proposes new ideas on what is needed for a computer to gain human level intelligence, they touch on paradoxes that arise from this idea and ethical concerns that surround creating artificial general intelligence. This essay will dig deeper into these ideas and discuss the moral and ethical consequences that AGI can pose on current and future society, considering the impact on jobs, and how this amplifies societal inequality and cyber security concerns that AI poses on the public.

One of the most prevalent issues with the advancement of AI is the problem of how further automation, especially in traditionally human-centric roles, can have a tremendous impact on the wider job market. This impact has been seen throughout every major technological revolution in history back to the initial industrial revolution in the 1700s when large-scale unemployment due to advancements in technology was documented for the first time in the hand spinning industry (Schneider, 2023). This trend has continued throughout modern history, Frey and Osborne, 2017 studied the potential impacts that automation could have on jobs and found that nearly half of jobs in the US are at risk of being automated. This issue is now more heavily exacerbated if you include AI in these calculations, sectors and skills like fine art, persuasion and the science and technology industry are now at greater risk of damage compared to Osborne and Frey’s study (Bruun and Duka, 2018). There is wide disagreement on AGI job displacement, however. The president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a US think tank, argues that it is unlikely for AI to have the damaging effects on people’s jobs that many researchers predict and instead just shift the perspective of job roles and complement job roles (Atkinson, 2018). Atkinson may be right in this perspective, however, there needs to be consideration of the difference between previous attempts at automation and this potential AI revolution which could lead to the creation of general intelligence.

As mentioned before, the risk that AGI will take over jobs deemed more ’human’ and the risk of the deskilling of jobs thought to be safe from this (Braverman, 1974), potentially created a sense of purposelessness within society and even civil unrest (Voth and Caprettini, 2017). The fallout of this is widespread socioeconomic damage, the tendency for corporations to prioritise maximising profits over the treatment of their employees (Chomsky, 1998) means if AI shows promise at being as efficient as humans (and in the future think like humans and gain consciousness) the diminished reliance on human workers could widen inequality in society. This issue highlights some of the ethical consequences that arise from creating AGI. A utilitarian view could see how the potential longer-term benefits of AGI presented by Atkinson (2018) could outweigh the initial deep harm it would cause society and continue pushing for the development of this technology. However, the damage may be too catas-  
trophic to recover from. A cautious approach is needed to minimise these risks.
