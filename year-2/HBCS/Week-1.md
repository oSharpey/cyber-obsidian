## Module Learning Outcomes
- Select and critically evaluate the usability criteria that security mechanisms must meet to be usable in their contexts of use
- Apply techniques from interaction design and security engineering to design and evaluate secure systems
- Analyse the relationship between user behaviour in digital space and cyber security consequences 

## Assessment
### CW1 - Security and Usability Trade-offs

### CW2 - Portfolio and Essay



## Underlying causes or security failures
- Measures cannot be effective if humans are neither willing not able to use them
- **Security needs to be usable and acceptable to be effective**
- Non-compliance caused by a trade off between productivity and security 

## Solution: Usable Security
- Education cannot help if a task is impossible


# How human behaviour contributed to the Magellan Health and Twitter cyber attacks

## Critical Human Factors
- Caused 2/3 of data breaches and security incidents in 2012
- Main critical factors
	- Communication
	- Management Support
	- Security Awareness

## Social Engineering Attack Taxonomy
- Human factors are difficult to deal with as they are hard to predict
- Attackers can crack the security of an information system by exploitation of human weaknesses

## Human factors involved in Magellan health and Twitter
- Awareness
- Communication
- Stress?

## Defining critical human factors
