Assessing difficulty of use 
- Sharing login information with trusted contacts: De-motivators
	- system: Bitwardens sending system is complex to use, lots of complex options, not efficient 
	- external: User will be more inclined to use a less secure but more efficicient method of sharing passwords ie sending them in plaintext
- Automatically autofilling passwords/card information
	- system: Autofilling sometimes does not always fill in the correct fields causing user to have to manually enter in the card/login information
	- system: Bitwarden hides autofill under a keyboard shortcut and is not shown to user as an option. User has to perform multiple clicks to get to the option of filling a password
	- External: build on point above, users who are older and have less technical ability and poorer eyesight may find it difficult to navigate to the autofill option in the browser extension or press the keyboard shortcut
	- External: Competition offers ability to autofill password from the login form, ie firefox actively prompts user to autofill using built in password manager bypassing bitwarden
	- System: bitwarden often saves the wrong url for the website, especially if the website sign up url is different to login, casues autofil to not work and user has to manually search for login in password manager
- Configuring TFA for the password manager to protect your account
	- system: logging in with TFA is time consuming and takes more effort than not using it
	- external: lack of awareness for te benifits of using TFA
	- external: Cost, users may be deterred if they see it may come with added cost, buying a physical key like ubikey or paying for
