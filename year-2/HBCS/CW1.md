- Automatically auto-filling a passwords and card information into a website 
- Configuring TFA for the password manager to protect your account

Threat Scenarios
- A user falling for a phisihing attack and having the password manager autofill passwords and/or card information
- Having passwords synced over multiple devices increases the possibility of having a password compromised - more devices you can leave unlocked 
- A user choosing a weak easy to remember master password that is easily found in a wordlist


Assessing difficulty of use 
- Sharing login information with trusted contacts: De-motivators
	- system: Bitwardens sending system is complex to use, lots of complex options, not efficient 
	- external: User will be more inclined to use a less secure but more efficicient method of sharing passwords ie sending them in plaintext
- Automatically autofilling passwords/card information
	- system: Autofilling sometimes does not always fill in the correct fields causing user to have to manually enter in the card/login information
	- system: Bitwarden hides autofill under a keyboard shortcut and is not shown to user as an option. User has to perform multiple clicks to get to the option of filling a password
