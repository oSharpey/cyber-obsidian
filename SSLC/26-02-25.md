- LLTCS marking 
	- people massively under marked
	- Not following the marking bands in the spec
	- extremely inconsistent 
	- Michael missed massive sections of student work. 
	- travesty really
- DSAC
	- Some errors in marking
	- specically with missing things students have done, ie student talks about handling missing data but feedback says they didnt
- Michael teaching
	- Disconnect between the slides and what is expected on the exam Henry has written
	- Content is DSAC is GCSE computer science level
	- quote, in the MATHS module, "Looking at these graphs makes me feel very mathsy"
	- Why is Henry not teaching us this considering he wrote the exam
	- Having machine learning on the exam feels odd as we have already been assessed on this
	- Teaching of DSAC feels like secondary school
