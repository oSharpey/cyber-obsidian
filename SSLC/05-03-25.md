- LLTCS marking (almost sorted?)
	- Under Marking
	- Not following the marking bands in the spec
	- feels inconsistent 
	- Sections of work missed when being marked
- Teaching/Content of DSAC
	- Disconnect between the slides and what is expected on the exam Henry has written
	- Content is DSAC is GCSE computer science level
	- Why is Henry not teaching us this considering he wrote the exam
	- Having machine learning on the exam feels odd as we have already been assessed on this
	- DSAC 2 exam on the same day as LLTCS deadline - ask to push lltcs deadline to the friday (25th april)
	- Described as CompSci 101 by the lecturer - feels out of place in third year of a degree.
- Result of Stage 2 Complaint
	- Clarification if by "Individual student finance account" they mean loan account or personal account
