# Intro to Computer Architecture 
## Some Background History
- First computer systems developed by Charles Babbage 
	- Difference engine and Analytical Engine
	- Used to solve polynomial calculations


- Electro-mechanical Machines 
	- Developed by Alan Turing
	- Invented the concept of the Turing Machine
	- One example is the Bombe used to break Enigma


- [[cpu-architecture|Von Neumann Model]] 
	- System used to describe most modern architectures 
	- Consists of:
		- ALU with registers
		- Control unit with an instruction register and program counter
		- Main memory to store data and instructions
		- Mass secondary storage 
		- Input and output mechanisms 


- 32 Bit architecture introduced with the Intel i386
	- Implemented the [[instruction-sets|x86 instruction set]]
	- Had a *Protected Mode*, so the user would interact in the *'User Space'* and not the *[[the-kernel|'Kernel Space']]*
	- The user can interact with the kernel through [[2-types-of-os|device drivers and libraries]]
