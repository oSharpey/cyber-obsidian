# Instruction Sets
- The majority of modern PCs use the Intel or AMD versions of the x86 (32bit) or x64 (64bit) instruction sets
- Phones, tablets, smartwatches, IOT devices etc mostly use 32bit ARM or 64bit ARM instruction sets


### CPU Instruction Set Architectures (ISA)
- ISA is the set of instructions used by the programmer or compiler to produce programs for a specific CPU architecture 
- **Specifies instructions, [[cpu-architecture|registers]], memory architecture, [[data-representation|data type & organisation]] etc native to the processor**

#### 2 Most Common ISA's
- CISC (Common Instruction Set Computing)
	- x86, IA-32, i386 - Intel 32bit architecture
	- x64, AMD64, x86_64 - Intel 64bit architecture 
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)
	- PowerPc, ARM, SPARC, MIPS
