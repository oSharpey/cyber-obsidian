# The Basics of CPU Architecture
- The CPU consists of the following components:
	- Control Unit - Fetches instruction from RAM using registers and the instruction pointer
	- [[registers]] - Temporary data storage within the CPU, much faster than RAM
	- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) - Performs calculations and executes instructions, stores results in registers or RAM
