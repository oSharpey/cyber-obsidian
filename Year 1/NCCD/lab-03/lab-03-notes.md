# Hubs
- Like a switch but with no memory 
- Layer 2

- Hubs broadcast out on all ports
- Useful for signal regeneration about 35 years ago
- Netkit uses hubs in `a[0] = LANX` type of commands

# Switches
- Like a hub but with memory
- Also called a bridge
- Switches start off effectively as a hub, but as network traffic goes through it the switch learns (caches MAC addresses)
